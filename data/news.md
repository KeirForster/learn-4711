**Week 3**  
This week's lesson is an overview of CodeIgniter.
I have also enabled the "Other frameworks" section in the organizer, with
examples.

This week's lab has been posted.

**Week 2**  
There are two short presentations for week 2, which
introduce the key concepts for MVC frameworks and collaborative workflow, respectively.
The number of asterisks in a slide's title denote emphasis, based on previous
student feedback.

This week's lab is about collaborative workflow.

**Week 1**  
Welcome to COMP4711 :)
