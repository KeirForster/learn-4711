**Assignment 1**

I have updated the starter4 repo ... actually removed some code that should
have been experimental (I got carried away, sorry).

I added an assignment FAQ, in the "assignments" tab below,
with more notes about using models.

Webhook setup coming very shortly.

**Week 5**
Reading & presentation posted. I will be talking about models in class, 
and lab will be spent completing the assignment.

The assignment 1 writeup has been fleshed out.

**Week 4**  
This week, we take a closer look at CodeIgniter
controllers and routing. The first lesson would suit
reading ahead, and there is a survey for it if you have
questions.

Lab 4 has been posted.

The assignment 1 DRAFT has been posted, in the "Assignments" section of the organizer.

**Lab 3**  
In the first tutorial for lab 3 (static to trivial), I forgot to mention that
the original HTML files in `public` should be deleted once copied into your
`application/views` folder. Leaving them inside `public` could result
in Apache dishing them instead of running your app, as soon as you move away from the home page.
