**Lab 3**  
In the first tutorial for lab 3 (static to trivial), I forgot to mention that
the original HTML files in `public` should be deleted once copied into your
`application/views` folder. Leaving them inside `public` could result
in Apache dishing them instead of running your app, as soon as you move away from the home page.

**Week 4**  
This week, we take a closer look at CodeIgniter
controllers and routing. The first lesson would suit
reading ahead, and there is a survey for it if you have
questions.

Lab 4 has been posted.
