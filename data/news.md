**Week 1**  
Welcome to COMP4711 :)

**Week 2**  
There are two short presentations for week 2, which
introduce the key concepts for MVC frameworks and collaborative workflow, respectively.
The number of asterisks in a slide's title denote emphasis, based on previous
student feedback.

The organizer line for each contains a link to a D2L survey that
you can use to tell me which parts of the material need better explanation.
The surveys close 9pm Monday.

This week's lab is about collaborative workflow.
