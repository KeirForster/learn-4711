**Week 3**  
This week's lesson is an overview of CodeIgniter.

A survey has been posted for any questions for me to address in class.
The survey closes at 9pm Monday.

I have also enabled the "Other frameworks" section in the organizer, with
examples.

**Week 2**  
There are two short presentations for week 2, which
introduce the key concepts for MVC frameworks and collaborative workflow, respectively.
The number of asterisks in a slide's title denote emphasis, based on previous
student feedback.

The organizer line for each contains a link to a D2L survey that
you can use to tell me which parts of the material need better explanation.
The surveys close 9pm Monday.

This week's lab is about collaborative workflow.

Survey results have been processed, and results presented.

**Week 1**  
Welcome to COMP4711 :)
