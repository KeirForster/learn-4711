**Week 6**  
Reading & presentation posted. 
Next week's lab will be posted after the assignment deadline.

**Assignment 1**

I have updated the starter4 repo ... actually removed some code that should
have been experimental (I got carried away, sorry).

The assignment FAQ, in the "assignments" tab below,
is being updated regularly, as more questions come in.


**Week 5**
Reading & presentation posted. I will be talking about models in class, 
and lab will be spent completing the assignment.

The assignment 1 writeup has been fleshed out.
