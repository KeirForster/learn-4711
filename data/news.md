**Week 1**  
Welcome to COMP4711 :)

**Week 2**  
There are two short presentations for week 2, which
introduce the key concepts for MVC frameworks and collaborative workflow, respectively.
The number of asterisks in a slide's title denote emphasis, based on previous
student feedback.

The organizer line for each contains a link to a D2L survey that
you can use to tell me which parts of the material need better explanation.
The surveys close 9pm Monday.

This week's lab is about collaborative workflow.

Survey results have been processed, and results presented.

A reminder for set COMP4S ... lab tomorrow has been moved to 10:30-12:30, but still in SE12-320.
