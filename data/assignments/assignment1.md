#Assignment #1 - Accessorize
COMP4711 - BCIT - Winter 2018

##Assignments Overview

The purpose of the assignments, collectively, is to have you apply the techniques 
from the lessons and tutorials.
In teams of three to five, you will be building a small but complete webapp, 
in our case to accessorize the gear for a person or vehicle. 

This will be done in two stages, with specific expectations for each stage. 
The second assignment will build on the first one.

The framework and a number of supporting technologies have been pre-decided. 
The techniques for applying these will be the subject of upcoming lessons and tutorials.

##Goals for This Assignment

The purpose of this assignment #1 is to get the basic pieces of your webapp 
in the correct places expected for a CodeIgniter webapp.
It is to use a mock database, and present
mock views (no business logic expected), just like in lab 3.

The important thing here is to get the right pieces in the right places.
You will add proper functionality "behind" the components in the next assignment.
